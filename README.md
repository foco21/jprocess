junprocess
===========================

This project is based on https://github.com/android/camera-samples/tree/main/Camera2Basic and is a
simple, open source solution to taking unprocessed images on your Android phone, free of
modern devices' excessive computational photography.

Introduction
------------
This is a legacy version of junporcess specifically build for android 9 (Pie) to android 5 (Lollipop)
Raw,jpeg, png ✅ supported.
Physical camera selector (wide ,telephoto and ultrawide) ✅
water mark with device/shot info is ✅

this branch focuses more on stability for older devices so updates will be slower than the main branch.

Getting Started

This sample uses the Gradle build system. To build this project, use the
"gradlew build" command or use "Import Project" in Android Studio.

Support
-------
This legacy version will be a lil behind as i backport a bunch of features from the main branch to this one but i will try my best to do it.
If you have any issues with your phone and it is running android 9 to android 5 please leave issues on this branch and not the main branch.
