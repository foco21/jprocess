junprocess
===========================

This project is based on https://github.com/android/camera-samples/tree/main/Camera2Basic and is a
simple, open source solution to taking unprocessed images on your Android phone, free of
modern devices' excessive computational photography.

Introduction
------------
This is a legacy version of junporcess specifically build for android 9 (Pie) to android 5 (Lollipop)
Raw,jpeg, png ✅ supported.
Physical camera selector (wide ,telephoto and ultrawide) ✅
water mark with device/shot info is ✅

this branch focuses more on stability for older devices so updates will be slower than the main branch.

take in any improvements that are able to be contributed.
